DESCRIPTION				 *ChangeGloballySmartCase-description*

As an add-on to the |ChangeGlobally.vim| plugin (vimscript #4321), this plugin
implements a |gC| variant that uses a "smart case" substitution which covers
variations in upper-/lowercase ("maxSize" vs. "MaxSize") as well as different
coding styles like CamelCase and underscore_notation ("maxSize", "MAX_SIZE").

The |gC| command works just like built-in |c|, and after leaving insert mode
applies the local substitution to all other occurrences (according to the
|SmartCase-rules|) in the current line (in case of a small character change)
or, when entire line(s) where changed, to the rest of the buffer.
This is especially useful for variable renamings and all the other small
tactical edits that you're doing frequently. It is much faster than doing a
single change and repeating it, or building a |:substitute| command,
especially since you would have to repeat that for all text variants that
SmartCase covers.

==============================================================================
USAGE					       *ChangeGloballySmartCase-usage*
								   *gC* *v_gC*
[N]["x]gC{motion}	Like |gc|, but also substitute close textual variants
{Visual}[N]["x]gC	of the changed text according to the |SmartCase-rules|:
			- variations in upper-/lowercase
			  ("maxSize" vs. "MaxSize")
			- different coding styles like CamelCase and
			  underscore_notation ("maxSize", "MAX_SIZE")
									 *gCC*
["x]gCC			Like |gcc|, but with |SmartCase-rules|. It's probably
			less useful than |gC|, but added for completeness.

							     *gX* *v_gX* *gXX*
[N]["x]gX{motion}	Like |gx|, but also substitute close textual variants
{Visual}[N]["x]gX	of the changed text according to the |SmartCase-rules|:
["x]gXX			Like |gxx|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.

								     *gC_star*
[N]["x]gC*{motion}	Delete the current whole \<word\> [into register x]
			and start inserting. After exiting insert mode, that
			text substitution, also to close textual variants
			according to the |SmartCase-rules|, is applied to all
			/ the first [N] occurrences inside {motion} text.
 *gX_star* *gCg_star* *gXg_star* *gC_ALT-8* *gX_ALT-8* *gCg_ALT-8* *gXg_ALT-8*
[N]["x]gX*{motion}	Like |gx_star|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gCg*{motion}	Like |gcg_star|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gXg*{motion}	Like |gxg_star|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gC_ALT-8{motion}	Like |gc_ALT-8|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gX_ALT-8{motion}	Like |gx_ALT-8|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gCg_ALT-8{motion}Like |gcg_ALT-8|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]gXg_ALT-8{motion}Like |gxg_ALT-8|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
						   *<Leader>gC* *v_<Leader>gC*
						   *<Leader>gX* *v_<Leader>gX*
[N]["x]<Leader>gC{source-motion}{target-motion}
			Delete {source-motion} text [into register x] and
			and start inserting. After exiting insert mode, that
			text substitution, also to close textual variants
			according to the |SmartCase-rules|, is applied to all
			/ the first [N] occurrences inside {target-motion}
			text.
{Visual}[N]["x]<Leader>gC{motion}
			Like |v_<Leader>gc|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
[N]["x]<Leader>gX{source-motion}{target-motion}
			Like |<Leader>gx|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.
{Visual}[N]["x]<Leader>gX{motion}
			Like |v_<Leader>gx|, but with |SmartCase-rules|.

EXAMPLE					     *ChangeGloballySmartCase-example*

Suppose you have a line like this, and you want to rename the type from
"NodeList" to "FooBarSet", and adapt the variable name, too:
function set nodeList(nodeList:NodeList):void; // Update node list. ~

With the cursor on the start of any of the "nodeList", type gCe, enter the
text "fooBarSet", then press <Esc>. The line will turn into
function set fooBarSet(fooBarSet:FooBarSet):void; // Update foo bar set. ~
You can now re-apply this substitution to other lines or a visual selection
via |.|

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION				*ChangeGloballySmartCase-installation*

The code is hosted in a Git repo at
    https://github.com/inkarkat/vim-ChangeGloballySmartCase
You can use your favorite plugin manager, or "git clone" into a directory used
for Vim |packages|. Releases are on the "stable" branch, the latest unstable
development snapshot on "master".

This script is also packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip"
decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise,
decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by
sourcing the vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim ChangeGloballySmartCase*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				*ChangeGloballySmartCase-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.040 or
  higher.
- ChangeGlobally.vim (vimscript #4321) plugin (version 2.00 or higher)
- SmartCase.vim (vimscript #1359)
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (optional)

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION			       *ChangeGloballySmartCase-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:
					       *ChangeGloballySmartCase-remap*
If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>(ChangeGloballySmartCase...) and <Plug>(DeleteGloballySmartCase...)
mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script (e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <Leader>C <Plug>(ChangeGloballySmartCaseOperator)
    nmap <Leader>CC <Plug>(ChangeGloballySmartCaseLine)
    xmap <Leader>C <Plug>(ChangeGloballySmartCaseVisual)
    nmap <Leader>X <Plug>(DeleteGloballySmartCaseOperator)
    nmap <Leader>XX <Plug>(DeleteGloballySmartCaseLine)
    xmap <Leader>X <Plug>(DeleteGloballySmartCaseVisual)

    nmap gC* <Plug>(ChangeWholeWordSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gX* <Plug>(DeleteWholeWordSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gCg* <Plug>(ChangeWordSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gXg* <Plug>(DeleteWordSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gC<A-8> <Plug>(ChangeWholeWORDSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gX<A-8> <Plug>(DeleteWholeWORDSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gCg<A-8> <Plug>(ChangeWORDSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap gXg<A-8> <Plug>(DeleteWORDSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap <Leader>gC <Plug>(ChangeOperatorSmartCaseOperator)
    nmap <Leader>gX <Plug>(DeleteOperatorSmartCaseOperator)

  to ChangeGlobally.vim (vimscript #4321) version 2.00! ***

1.30	12-Dec-2014
- Adapt to interface changes of ChangeGlobally.vim version 1.30
- ENH: Implement global delete (gX{motion}, gXX) as a specialization of an
  empty change.
  *** You need to update to ingo-library (vimscript #4433) version 1.021 and
  to ChangeGlobally.vim (vimscript #4321) version 1.30! ***

1.20	19-Nov-2013
- Adapt to interface changes of ChangeGlobally.vim version 1.20
- Use optional visualrepeat#reapply#VisualMode() for normal mode repeat of a
  visual mapping. When supplying a [count] on such repeat of a previous
  linewise selection, now [count] number of lines instead of [count] times the
  original selection is used.

1.00	23-Nov-2012
